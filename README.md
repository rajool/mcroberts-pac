# McRoberts PAC website

The website of the Parent Advisory Council of Hugh McRoberts Secondary, Richmond, BC.

**Status: preview.** A draft proposal, not yet approved by the PAC executive. Every page carries a preview banner and a `noindex` tag, and facts still to be confirmed show a "TBC" chip.

## How it works

Plain HTML and CSS, one small JavaScript file, and a build script that uses only the Python standard library (Python 3.9 or newer).

```
data/site.json     what changes during the year (school year, meetings, executive, links, school dates, preview switch)
src/               one HTML fragment per page
partials/          shared layout, preview banner, header, footer
assets/            CSS, JS, self-hosted fonts, icons
tools/             HTML sources of the social image and the touch icon (see below)
later/             draft pages that are not built (Chinese summaries)
build.py           stitches it together into docs/ and writes the calendar files
docs/              the built site that GitHub Pages serves (commit it)
COMPONENTS.md      how to write a page
HANDOVER.md        how to keep the site up to date
CLAUDE.md          rules for AI assistants working in this public repo
```

```
python3 build.py                       build into docs/
python3 build.py --today 2026-10-14    build as if it were another day
```

The build writes to a scratch folder and replaces `docs/` only when it succeeds. Which meetings and school dates count as upcoming depends on the real date: the build drops past dates, and `assets/js/site.js` hides the ones that pass between builds. Rebuild after each meeting (see HANDOVER.md).

## Where facts come from

The PAC's own records: meeting minutes, the bylaws, bank and treasurer reports. Money figures follow the source rule in [COMPONENTS.md, section 5](COMPONENTS.md#5-writing-rules): they come from `data.js` in [mcroberts-pac-report](https://github.com/rajool/mcroberts-pac-report) and keep its status. Nothing from private family or PAC correspondence belongs in this repo.

## Images

`assets/img/og.png` (social preview, 1200 by 630) and `assets/img/touch-icon.png` (180 by 180) are screenshots of `tools/og.html` and `tools/touch.html` at exactly those sizes, taken in a desktop browser. `assets/img/mark.svg` is the mark itself. The mark in `tools/og.html` uses a lighter green (`#24502A`), because the card behind it is already `#1B3C1F`.
